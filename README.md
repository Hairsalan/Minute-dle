About: Minute-dle is a React based application that functions as a modified version of Wordle. Alongside the original gameplay mechanics, Minute-dle introduces an additional obstacle for players: a 60 second timer to compete with. A player may now lose the game by either running out of guesses OR time. 

Its features include:

-Functional Components and React Hooks: Leveraged React's functional components and hooks such as useState, useEffect, and custom hooks (e.g., useWordle) for state management and side effects, illustrating a modern approach to React development.

-Conditional Rendering: Implemented conditional rendering techniques to manage game states and user interfaces, such as displaying different UI elements based on the game's progress and outcomes.

-Fetch API for Asynchronous Requests: Used the Fetch API to asynchronously fetch word data from an external API

-CSS Animations: Employed CSS animations for game interactions, such as flipping and bouncing effects, to create a more engaging and interactive user experience.
